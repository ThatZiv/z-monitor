# z-monitor

## TODO

- [X] Add sqlite for persitent time tracking
- [X] make master password
- [X] **Fix recursive cursor issue**
    - [ ] test if these [locks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26629080/python-and-sqlite3-programmingerror-recursive-use-of-cursors-not-allowed) ruin or defer any sort of tracking
    - If it does, should I try a [queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/) instead?
- [ ] log activity changes (processes list?)
- [X] Continue get_logs custom filter for type w/ htmx frontend (use events?
- [ ] way to do headless initialization (no prompt for password on first run)
    - [ ] make config -> to json file that gets removed __after__ first run
    - [ ] or just build out a simple gui?
- [X] implement flask api
- [X] implement web interface
    - [ ] set time
    - [ ] change password
    - [X] pass pc specs to (polling route)
- [ ] ~~implement websockets for real-time updates~~
- [ ] use ssl

## Caveats

- Deleting the db file will reset the timer and password
- Only works on the same local network (intentional caveat)
